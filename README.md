# Unprotocols RFC

Unprotocols RFC is a repository for universal, cross-project protocols used in
software development, ranging from workflow to technical ones.

It has started as a new home for C4 and COSS protocols to elevate their prominence and articulate their usefulness outside of the original projects'
boundaries. More protocols are welcome to join this project.

You can start contributing by sending a pull request to https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc on GitHub.
